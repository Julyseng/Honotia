      <h2>About</h2>
      <h4> Honotia means the action of connection in Te Reo Maori.</h4>
        <p>Since 1956 till today, New Zealand accepts refugees from all over the world.
          In 2018, refugee quota has increased to 1000 per year. Every refugee spends
          the first six weeks in Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre where they are
          supported with English Language classes, health screening and mental health.
          Moving to a new country and starting all over is not easy. You are either excited,
          nervous or overwhelmed stepping into a foreign land without knowing where to begin.
          Although there are many supports available after the six weeks programme, they are
          scattered all over the place and individual support are either limited or non-existence.
        </p>

        <p> If you are a refugee who just arrived in New Zealand, we would like to help you connect
          with other refugees or Ally who are interested to support you and make your journey a
          little easier. Honotia is a place where you find allies and former refugees for the
          continued support and build your network of people.
        </p>
