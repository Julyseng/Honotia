        Since 1956 till today, New Zealand accepts refugees from all over the
        world. In 2018, refugee quota has increased to 1000 per year. Every
        refugee spends the first six weeks in Mangere Refugee Resettlement
        Centre where they are supported with English Language classes, health
        screening and mental health. Moving to a new country and starting all
        over is not easy. You are either excited, nervous or overwhelmed
        stepping into a foreign land without knowing where to begin. Although
        there are many supports available after the six weeks programme, they
        are scattered all over the place and individual support are either
        limited or non-existent.
        <br /> <br />
        Honotia is a place created for newly arrived refugees to connect with
        former refugees and allies for the continued support and connection to
        make the journey a little easier.
