- woah, where are the tests?
- [x] unused or failing tests need to be skipped or removed
- [x] '/s3' routes should be put under the /api/v1 prefix
- [x] move the require('dotenv').config() from each route to the index.js
- [x] remove console.log in line 10 of apiClient
- [x] if action and reducers aren't being used then move them out of master until they are don
- [x] I would move all the page components into their own folder
- html in navbar is feeling a little large, I would consider refactoring out a couple of small components
- form components are shaping up well I would suggest the following plan
  - get them working with manual tests
  - put them under automated tests
  - refactor
  - make a call on switching them to redux rather than a parent form
